# Noven roadmap

**What this file is:** the single running list of what's done and what's left.
Update it at the end of every working session — tick things off, add what we
learned, and write the next session's starting point at the bottom.

**How we're working:** we build the minimum needed to take a real client, then
let real client work tell us what to build next. We don't design processes for
situations we haven't met yet. Anything we don't know is written as
`[PLACEHOLDER]` rather than guessed.

The three phases overlap — outreach starts before the build is perfect, and
the first delivery will change both.

---

## Where we are today

The website is built and works. Seven static pages (home, how it works,
pricing, FAQ, about, contact, 404), fully readable by AI crawlers, with
machine-readable business facts and a sitemap. It builds clean and is ready to
deploy the moment we have a domain.

What doesn't exist yet: a contact email on the site, a live domain, a way to
take payment, and a repeatable process for doing the audit we're selling.

**Blocking everything:** a customer who reads the site today cannot contact us.
That's the single most urgent fix.

---

## Phase 1 — Build (get to a site that can take a real customer)

### 1a. Facts only the owner can supply

These are all marked `[PLACEHOLDER]` in the site. Nothing else in Phase 1
matters until these exist. Search the repo for `[PLACEHOLDER` to find them all.

- [ ] **Contact email address** — the only sales channel on the site
- [ ] Phone number, or a decision that we don't offer one
- [ ] Reply time we're willing to promise (e.g. "within one working day")
- [ ] Location — "based in ___, working across the UK"
- [ ] Founder name and short bio for the About page (photo optional)
- [ ] Registered company name, company number, registered address (footer)
- [ ] Whether prices include VAT
- [ ] Cancellation notice period for monthly plans (appears in three places)
- [ ] Audit turnaround time — how long from payment to report
- [ ] Typical Foundation delivery time

### 1b. Domain and hosting

- [ ] Confirm and buy the domain (site currently assumes `noven.co.uk` — unconfirmed)
- [ ] Update the domain in `site/astro.config.mjs` and `site/public/robots.txt`
- [ ] Connect the repo to Netlify (`netlify.toml` is already set up correctly)
- [ ] Point DNS, confirm HTTPS works
- [ ] Set up the business email address on the domain

### 1c. Taking money

The site says payment is arranged "by reply". Decide the actual mechanism:

- [ ] Business bank account in place
- [ ] How the £30 audit gets paid — bank transfer, a payment link, or an invoice
- [ ] How the £350 Foundation gets paid
- [ ] How monthly plans get collected (this matters most — manual collection
      stops being viable somewhere around client five)
- [ ] A simple invoice or receipt we can send

### 1d. Legal basics

- [ ] Privacy notice page — we'll be handling client business data and email
- [ ] Terms of service, or a short plain-English version of what we promise
- [ ] Decide sole trader vs limited company (the footer text depends on it)

### 1e. Launch checks

- [ ] Read every page top to bottom with fresh eyes, out loud
- [ ] Check the site on a phone
- [ ] Submit the sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
- [ ] Ask ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot and Perplexity what Noven does — record the
      answers, dated. This is our own before-and-after, and our first proof.

**Phase 1 is done when:** a stranger can read the site, understand the offer,
email us, and pay us £30.

---

## Phase 2 — Outreach (how we get the first clients)

The honest position: we're new with no case studies, and the site says so. The
whole outreach strategy follows from that — we cannot win on proof yet, so we
win on being specific, being cheap to try, and being obviously not a scam.

The £30 audit *is* the outreach tool. It's priced to be an easy yes, not to
make money.

### 2a. Before contacting anyone

- [ ] Write down who we're actually targeting first — one trade, one area.
      "Accountants and solicitors across the UK" is too broad to write a good
      email to. Pick something like "independent accountants in [town]".
- [ ] Decide how many we can realistically deliver for at once
- [ ] Set a working definition of what a good first client looks like

### 2b. The first approach — do the work before asking

The approach that fits our position: run a mini version of the audit *before*
making contact, so the first email contains a real finding about their
business, not a pitch.

- [ ] Build a shortlist of [PLACEHOLDER: number] businesses
- [ ] For each: ask the assistants the question their customers would ask, and
      record whether the business is mentioned
- [ ] Write the outreach email — short, one specific finding, the £30 offer,
      no chasing sequence
- [ ] Send in small batches so we can change the email based on replies
- [ ] Keep a simple record of who we contacted, when, and what came back

### 2c. Warm routes (likely the first paying client)

- [ ] List existing contacts — anyone who runs a business or knows people who do
- [ ] Personal approach to each, offering the audit
- [ ] Ask satisfied clients for one introduction each — the only referral
      mechanism we need for now
- [ ] [PLACEHOLDER: local business groups, networking, trade bodies worth trying]

### 2d. Proof — the thing that unlocks everything else

Our biggest constraint is having nothing to show. Fixing that is the priority
of the first few engagements.

- [ ] Get written permission to publish results from the first clients
- [ ] Record before-and-after: what the assistants said before, what they say
      after, both dated
- [ ] Publish the first case study on the home page, replacing the placeholder
- [ ] Publish our own before-and-after — we're our own first test case

### 2e. Later, only if the above works

Don't start these until we have paying clients and proof:

- [ ] Writing that answers the questions our own customers ask
- [ ] LinkedIn or wherever our buyers actually are
- [ ] [PLACEHOLDER: decide after the first ten conversations]

**Phase 2 is working when:** we have a repeatable way of getting conversations,
and we know roughly how many approaches produce one paid audit.

---

## Phase 3 — Outcome (actually doing the work we've promised)

This phase is deliberately thin. We'll write the real process while doing the
first audit for a real client, not before.

### 3a. The audit (£30)

What we've promised on the site: what each assistant says when asked about
businesses like theirs; what they know and believe about this business and
whether it's accurate; what's blocking them, in plain English; and an honest
recommendation including "you don't need us".

- [ ] Write the list of questions we ask the assistants, and how we vary them
      by trade and area
- [ ] Decide which assistants we check, and record how we record answers
- [ ] Build the checklist of things we look at on their website
- [ ] Build the audit report template — short, plain English, no jargon
- [ ] Do the first one end to end and time it. £30 has to be sustainable, so
      if it takes a day, the process is wrong, not the price.
- [ ] Rewrite the process based on what the first one taught us

### 3b. The Foundation (£350)

What we've promised: crawler access, structured machine-readable business
facts, consistent facts across the web, and pages that answer customer
questions — all on the client's existing site. We don't build websites.

- [ ] Write the Foundation checklist, mapped to what the audit found
- [ ] Work out how we get access to a client's website safely, and what we do
      when we can't (their site is on a platform we can't edit)
- [ ] Decide what happens when the client's site is too broken for the
      Foundation to work — the audit is supposed to say so honestly
- [ ] Agree what we hand over at the end, and how we show what changed
- [ ] Do the first one, time it, then fix the process

### 3c. Monthly plans (£75 / £125 / £250)

- [ ] Define what actually happens each month at each level, concretely enough
      that a client would recognise the value
- [ ] Decide how we check and report visibility each month
- [ ] Write the monthly client update — short and readable
- [ ] Define the quarterly review promised on the Lead plan
- [ ] Work out how many clients one person can hold at each level

### 3d. Keeping track of clients

The `ops/spine.md` file is meant to hold this and is currently empty. Keep it
minimal — a spreadsheet is fine until it isn't.

- [ ] Record per client: business, contact, what they want to be found for,
      area served, stage, plan, what we've done, dated visibility checks
- [ ] Set up wherever the audits and reports live

### 3e. The internal docs we've stubbed out

All three files in `ops/` are TODO stubs. These are worth writing *after* the
first client, when we know what's actually true.

- [ ] `ops/org-chart.md` — the five company seats
- [ ] `ops/spine.md` — the shared client and prospect data model
- [ ] `ops/escalation-rules.md` — the three "never do this without me" rules

**Phase 3 is working when:** we can do an audit and a Foundation to a
consistent standard without reinventing them each time, and a client on a
monthly plan gets something real every month.

## Open questions for the owner

Written down rather than guessed at. Answer them as they become relevant.

- Is `noven.co.uk` the domain, and do we own it?
- Sole trader or limited company?
- Are we VAT registered?
- Which trade and which area do we go after first?
- How much time per week is there for delivery? This caps everything.
- Is there any existing contact who could be client number one?

---

## Session log

Add a short entry at the end of each session — what changed, what we learned,
what's next. Newest at the top.

### 2026-07-27
- Reviewed the whole repo and confirmed the site builds clean (7 pages + sitemap).
- Wrote this roadmap.
- **State:** website content is done; launch is blocked on owner-supplied facts
  (contact email above all), a confirmed domain, a way to take payment, and a
  repeatable audit process.
- **Next session:** collect the Phase 1a facts and fill in every `[PLACEHOLDER]`,
  then get the site deployed.
